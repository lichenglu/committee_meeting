							Good afternoon dear committee members! Thank you so much for taking the time to join me today. I guess we all know each other as I have either taken courses or worked on projects with you. However, you might wonder, what Chenglu is doing everyday?! So the purpose of today's meeting is to let you get to know me better. Specifically, I will go through my background, both educational and professional background.

						<h3>Background</h3>

					<section data-auto-animate>
						<aside class='notes'>I double majored in Business Vietnamese and Finance for my undergraduate study. I hated Finance but now I am glad I took it because the maths training allows me to teach myself how to program, and how to conduct data analysis. I was very close to get a master degree in data science. As you might know, I transferred to UF from UT Austin, where I was taking a concurrent master's degree in data science. I have three more courses and a report to graduate, but I did not finish them since I transferred.</aside>

							I have got credits for all the foundational courses in ed-tech. For research methods course, I have taken a quantitative foundation at UF. But I have not taken a qualitative one. Although I took one back to UT, I felt it might be a good idea for me to take another one as I did not realize how important and insightful qualitative research was.

						<h3>Research Experience</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							As you might see in the earlier fancy animation where the word fair learning analytics was highlighted, my major research interest resides in exploring & examining methods to enhance the fairness of LA. Why? Because LA uses lots of machine learning algorithms, and machine learning models can be biased. We definitely do not want the existing social biases reflected in our LA models. Imagine how students will feel if a prediction model fails a student simply because the student has a dark skin. Biased LA can lead to trustworthy issues between LA and students. When people don't trust your algorithm, it is hard to fulfill the purpose of LA, which is to support teaching and learning. However, Little is known whether LA applications in education are Fair.

						<h3>Research Experience: Fair LA</h3>
						<aside class="notes">							
							In this study, we have proposed a fair logistic regression algorithm, following a framework called Seldonian framework. Conceptually, what fair logistic regression does is to allow researchers to define fairness constraints. There are several metrics we can adopt to quantify fairness. In general, these metrics measure how well separated predictions are among different memberships. For example, if Asian students receive more correct predictions simply because of their race, then it is not fair. So the fairness constraints in fair logistic regression allows us to define a minimum value for those fairness metrics. This way, the model will learn to make fairer predictions.

						</div>

						<aside class="notes">
							Here is an example project that I was leading. So Telelab is a cloud based lab to support students' learning in chemistry and physics. We call Telelab a remote lab 2.0, because just like the major difference between web 1.0 and 2.0 is user-generated content. Remote lab 2.0 allows students to be a tictoker doing science. We allowed users to not only create their own experiments, but also allow them to stream their works in real time. We have conducted several studies, investigating students' engagement and leraning gains on high school chemistry. Through trace data analysis and pre- post-tests, we found that Telelab could effectively engage students and significantly contribute to students' learning.
